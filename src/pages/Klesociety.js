                        <p>KLE is a byword in India’s Educational spectrum. Its success story, of nearly ten decades, portrays the dedication with which millions of people worked selflessly in the making of the ‘KLE’. Its 296 institutions spread across Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Delhi etc., narrate amazing stories differently, yet, a harmony is maintained without amiss. Our alumni spread across the world are unofficial ambassadors promoting ‘Brand KLE’</p>
                        <p>With its network of 296 institutions, the K.L.E. Society has been converted into an “Educational Empire” by sheer commitment and democratic management of the board of trustees in the sphere of Healthcare, Medical, Engineering, Management, I.T., Law, Pharmacy, Nursing and many more conventional as well as non-conventional disciplines. Exceeding 5 billion inexhaustible assets, manning over 18,000 employees moulding the destinies of 1,38,000 students right from K.G. to Post Doctoral studies, the society has been a brand name not only in India but even globally.</p>
                        <p>The Society’s magic growth, in the last two decades gone by, tells a tale of the selfless efforts of the members of Board of Management of the society who have kept the spirit of ceaseless endeavors and service-mindedness of the Founding Fathers alive till today. It is certain that under the able, dynamic and spirited leadership of Dr Parbhakar B. Kore, as a Chairman, and under the active guidance of its President, Shri Mahantesh S. Koujalgi , the society would place its name at the height that shall set a new standard for the generations unborn.</p>
                        <p>K.L.E. Society has the First deemed University in North Karnataka and acquired a university status as K.L.E. University to a couple of its institutions.</p>

                        <p>A little over nine decades, the region of Karnataka, witnessed the rise of a new phenomenon, the K.L.E. Society, Belgaum. It was the most selfless and voluntary act that transformed the gloomy educational climate of the then Bombay province. The singular act of the starting of the K.L.E. Society in 1916 by seven dedicated teachers and their patrons, set the beginning of the most spectacular event that has changed the course of the history of Karnataka, especially that of North Karnataka.</p>
                        <p>We, KLE as a family, believe that education empowers and benefits academic aspirants and society at large. KLE has a vision of high-quality lifelong learning, accessible to all harboring the tenacity of being first among equals; instilling professional competency in our students with vigour and zeal. KLE always has the learner at the heart of everything we do. We raise expectations, set benchmarks, and work together progressively towards the objective of nurturing intellectual capital for the nation.</p>
                        <p>Karnataka Lingayat Education Society, established in 1916 by a group of seven dedicated teachers popularly known as “Saptarshis” with a vision of creating a strong education base in North Karnataka. The KLE Society has grown from 37 institutions in 1984 to a magnanimous Empire of 300 institutions today covering Healthcare, Technology, Agriculture, Law & Basic Sciences and Management. The society has redesigned and redefined itself to meet the needs of the 21st Century. Also the Society was able to take health care to the door steps of the people and also successfully initiated the formation of KLE University. Institutions of higher learning need to continually innovate and read adapt themselves to the changing circumstances to face the challenge of the global competition. Quality alone can ensure success. The better way of improving higher education is to give academic freedom to modernize curriculum and offer relevant courses for the benefit of stakeholders and contribute to nation building; Hence autonomy has provided the key to enhance quality of higher education. I invite the students, parents and other stakeholders of higher education to join us in endeavor to achieve progress and prosperity for one and all. The shaping of the future of our children and students is our responsibility. While we take pride in our past we have promise to keep for the future. I wish health, wealth, prosperity and harmony to one and all.</p>
